    <h1>🔒 Secure Boot — Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    
    <p>This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and configuring Secure Boot.</p>
    
    <!-- Step 1 -->
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-number">Step 1: Introduction</div>
      <div class="step-title">What is information security and what are CIA security properties?</div>
      <div class="step-content">
        <p>Information Security is the degree of resistance to / protection from harm to a valuable asset, which could be code, user data, or information.</p>
        <p><strong>CIA Properties:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>C</strong>onfidentiality: Information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorised entities.<br>
          In the context of firmware, this means not giving access to firmware to any external entity by blocking flash read operations.<br>
          Though it is not a part of secure boot, this avoids copying of firmware images by unknown sources.
          </li>
          <li><strong>I</strong>ntegrity: Maintaining and ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data. Data cannot be modified in an unauthorised or undetected manner.<br>
          </li>
          <li><strong>A</strong>vailability: Information is available when needed. Computing systems store and process information,<br>
             security controls are used to protect it, and communication channels are used to access it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="step-title" style="margin-top: 30px;">Why the need for secure boot?</div>
        <p>Secure boot is needed to ensure an embedded device only runs authentic, untampered firmware from power-on, blocking persistent malware and unauthorized changes that could compromise safety, data, or networks. It is more important in devices which connect to the internet and support over-the-air updates, to avoid malicious attacks and unauthorized access to devices.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Step 2 -->
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-number">Step 2: Prerequisites</div>
      <div class="step-title"> Hardware must support secure boot, usually flash protection!</div>
      <div class="step-content">
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p>To make the boot loader secure, we must have a hashing algorithm, such as SHA-256, ready to generate a firmware digest for the application image, and public and private keys to sign the firmware digest and metadata, using an algorithm like RSA-2048/256-bit or ECDSA.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Three Important Parts of Secure Boot:</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>1. Firmware Confidentiality:</strong> This is achieved by making the flash read-protected, so it cannot be read by any external entity. This is particularly used for the bootloader to prevent unauthorized access to the firmware code.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Firmware Integrity:</strong> This is achieved by hashing the firmware image using SHA-256 algorithms to generate the hash/firmware digest, which is then stored at a secure location. This ensures that any tampering with the firmware can be detected.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Firmware Authenticity:</strong> This is achieved by signing the image and then verifying the signature before starting the application, using algorithms like RSA or ECDSA. This process uses private and public keys, with the public key stored at a fixed flash address to be used by the bootloader to verify the signature.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Step 3 -->
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-number">Step 3: Configuration</div>
      <div class="step-title">Flash memory layout configuration:</div>
      <p>To set up secure boot, the bootloader and the application must be built and stored
      separately. Reserve two dedicated flash regions: one for the bootloader at the beginning of flash, and another for the application. Additionally, reserve a fixed flash address for the
      public key used for signature verification—commonly placed immediately after the bootloader and before the application.
      This public key region can be at any fixed flash location, but it must be protected, immutable, and treated as secure.</p>
      <div class="step-title">Setting Up Secure Boot</div>
      <div class="step-content">
        <p>First, we have to secure the flash region where the boot loader is located, so that this memory cannot be accessed by anything other than the bootloader code. On STM microcontrollers, this can be achieved using the secure flash page option. Additionally, we must make the bootloader flash memory region write-protected, so that it cannot be overwritten or erased.</p>

    <!-- Step 4 -->
    <div class="step">
      <div class="step-number">Step 4: Signature Generation and Verification</div>
      <div class="step-title">Signature Generation and Verification Flow</div>
      <div class="step-content">
        <p><strong>1. Signature Generation</strong></p>
        <p>Signature generation is the process of creating a cryptographic signature for firmware or boot images to ensure their integrity and authenticity.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p><strong>2. Signature Verification Flow</strong></p>
        <p>Signature verification is the process of validating the cryptographic signature during the boot process to ensure the firmware has not been tampered with.</p>
